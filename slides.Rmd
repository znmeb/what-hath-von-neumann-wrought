# Motivation

## Standing on the shoulders of giants
* "If I have seen farther than others, it is because I was standing on the shoulders of giants." - Isaac Newton 
* "If I have not seen as far as others, it is because giants were standing on my shoulders." - Hal Abelson 
* "In computer science, we stand on each other's feet." - Brian Reid
* "How many people can stand on the shoulders of a giant before the giant collapses?" - znmeb

## We program today in a rich environment
* numerous abstract programming paradigms,
* elegant realizations of those paradigms in programming languages,
* well-crafted run-times, interpreters and compilers,
* distributed version control systems for collaboration,
* integrated development environments, and
* documentation tools.

## Programming paradigms (mid 1960s to the present)
* Object-oriented programming
    - [Simula67](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula) (1967), [Smalltalk-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) (1980)
* Functional programming
    - [OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml) (1996), [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)) (1990)
* Array programming
    - [MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB) (1984), [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)) (1976), [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) (1994), [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) (1966)
* Symbolic math
    - [Maxima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_(software)) (1998), [Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematica) (1998)

## What made all this possible?
* Transistor logic
* Magnetic core random access memory
* General-purpose architectures like [System\\360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360) (1964)

## And before that?
* Two kinds of computers - "scientific" and "business"
* Two languages - FORTRAN and COBOL

## Like Hell It Was!
* By July of 1969, large System\\360 mainframes were in use at NASA
* Even in 1961, the state of the art was an [IBM 7090](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_7090)
* \</rant\>

## I've taken away ...
* Your IDEs, version control, the Internet
    - Sorry, you can't Google an error message any more
* Your programming paradigms
* But hey, at least you've got FORTRAN and COBOL
* At least your computer's transistorized

## April 1957
* The first [FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) compiler is delivered ...
* For the [IBM 704](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704) ... a vacuum tube machine
* With floating point hardware and index registers
* And magnetic core memory
* I'm not finished

## April 1952
* The [IBM 701](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_701) is announced
* No floating point
* No index registers
* Cathode ray tube memory
* ***Based on the [IAS machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAS_machine)***

## And so, time travelers, we've arrived at our destination

What Hath Von Neumann (and many others) Wrought?

# The IAS machines

## Some books for historical perspective
* _John Von Neumann: The Scientific Genius who Pioneered the Modern Computer, Game Theory, Nuclear Deterrence, and Much More_ [@Macrae2000]
* _The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann_ [@Goldstine2008]
* _Turing's Cathedral_ [@Dyson2012]

## It all started with ...
["Preliminary Discussion of the Logical Design of an Electronic Computing Instrument"](http://grch.com.ar/docs/p1/Apuntes/eng/Logical%20Design%20of%20an%20Electronic%20Computing%20Instrument.pdf) [@Burks1946]. 

* That defined the architecture and a plan for the hardware. 
* Engineers in many cases followed the plan with some modifications.

## And the software?
["Planning and coding of problems for an electronic computing instrument"](http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/ias/Planning_and_Coding_of_Problems_for_an_Electronic_Computing_Instrument_Part_II_Volume_II_Apr48.pdf) [@Goldstine1948]

# The architecture

## The memory
* 4096 words of "Selectron" memory in the original design
* Words were binary, 40 bits each
* Some implementations had fewer words; for example ILLIAC only had 1024

## A key concept - programs and data occupying the same memory space!
* A program could act on either data or instructions

## Arithmetic unit
* A 40-bit accumulator (A)
* A 40-bit multiplier-quotient register (Q)
* A memory register, called R3
* A complement gate
* An adder
* We number bits from left to right starting at 0
* Left-most bit of A is a0 and right-most is a39, etc.

## The arithmetic unit
```{r echo = FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("arith_unit.gv")
```

## Fractional fixed-point two's-complement arithmetic
* Most arithmetic assumed numbers were two's-complement fractions
* Smallest number (hexadecimal): 80000 00000 (-1)
* Largest number (hexadecimal): 7FFFF FFFFF (+1 - 2 ^ -39)
* 1/2 = 40000 00000
* -1/2 = C0000 00000
* A sign bit (leftmost bit) and 39 bits of precision = 40 bits

## Double-precision
* Some operations treated A and Q as the most and least significant parts of a fraction with a sign and 78 bits of precision
* The left-most bit of A (a0) is the sign bit
* The left-most bit of Q (q0) is ignored
* Multiplying two single-precision numbers could produce a double-precision product
* Dividing a double-precision dividend by a single-precision divisor produced a single-precision quotient

## The accumulator (A) and quotient register (Q) coupled

```{r echo = FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("aq.gv")
```

## Left Shifting = multiply AQ by two
1. Shift a0 -> bit bucket
2. Shift a1:a39 -> a0:a38
3. Leave q0 alone!
4. Shift q1 -> a39
5. Shift q2:q39 -> q1:q38
6. Zero -> q39

## Right Shifting = divide AQ by two
1. Shift q39 -> bit bucket
2. Shift q1:q38 -> q2:q39
3. Leave q0 alone!
4. Shift a39 -> q1
5. Shift a0:a38 -> a1:a39
6. Keep original a0 - the sign bit propagates to the right!

## Adding or Subtracting
1. Augend is in A
    * Clear A, or
    * Hold A, or
    * Set A = 1/2
2. Addend
    * Memory word or Q to R3, then
3. Complement gate
    * Pass straight through, or
    * Negate, or
    * Absolute value
3. Form sum in A

## Multiplication: initialization
1. Multiplier is in Q
2. Multiplicand is in R3
3. Accumulator
    * Clear A (full multiply -> AQ), or
    * Set A = 1/2 (rounded multiply - A)
4. Complement gate
    * Pass straight through, or
    * Negate, or
    * Absolute value

## Multiplication: iteration
39 steps of

* A <- A + Complement gate
* Shift AQ right one bit

## Division
1. Start with double-precision dividend in AQ
2. Divisor is in R3
3. 39 steps of
    * subtract R3 from A in the adder
    * if the result is less than zero, set q39 to 0
    * if the result is greater than or equal to zero, set q39 to 1 and copy the result to A
    * shift AQ left one place, copying q1 into q0
4. Set q39 to 1 for rounding

## Control
* Two 20-bit orders in a 40-bit word
* The order was usually an 8-bit order code and a 12 bit address
* A program counter with a left-right indicator

## Control flow
* Fetch the order pair at the location specified by the program counter
* Execute the left order unless it's a control transfer
* Execute the right order unless it's a control transfer
* Increment the program counter and repeat

## Control transfers
* Unconditional: set the program counter to the order address and execute either the left or right order there
* Conditional: transfer control only if the sign bit of A is positive

## Stops
* Control transfers could be coded to stop before transfer
* Stop orders
* Division overflow detected
* Unimplemented order code bits

# The software engineering process

## Algorithms
* Calculus / differential equations
* Statistics / Monte Carlo
* Linear algebra / linear equations / eigensystems
* ["Planning and coding"](http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/ias/Planning_and_Coding_of_Problems_for_an_Electronic_Computing_Instrument_Part_II_Volume_II_Apr48.pdf) has a good introduction to the type of computations

## Memory layout
* Since program orders and data words occupy the same memory, you have to lay them out ahead of time

## Available software
* [Primitive assemblers / loaders](http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/univOfIllinoisUrbana/illiac/ILLIAC/Active_Library/X12-235_SADOI.pdf) to read in instructions
* Data input and output routines (decimal-to-binary and binary-to-decimal)
* Math libraries accessible as closed subroutines

## Documentation
* Best available now is for ILLIAC: _A Guide to ILLIAC Programming_ [@Fosdick1961] 

## Debugging / post-mortem
* Memory dumps
* Breakpoint stops
* Sometimes lights and switches, single-stepping

# The emulator

## Existing emulators
* [simh](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/)
    - Open source (<https://github.com/simh/simh>)
    - Written in C
    - Doesn't have any IAS machines 
* [IASSim]()
    - Open source (http://www.cs.colby.edu/djskrien/IASSim/)
    - Written in Java
    - Includes a primitive formula translator

## My own emulator
* Work in progress
* Currently in R
    - This is surprisingly difficult
    - R doesn't have a native 64-bit integer type!
    - So I'm storing 40-bit words in 64-bit floats
    - Using the `binaryLogic` package to emulate arithmetic unit
* Target architecture is ILLIAC (best documentation)
* Will probably abandon R for Julia

## What's working
* Multiply and divide
* Post-mortem dump / display
